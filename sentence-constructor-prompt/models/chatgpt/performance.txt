hint
ChatGPT said:
Here are three hints to help you:

Japanese follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order. In this case, the verb "is" (です, desu) will come at the end.
Adjectives generally come before the noun they modify. So, "beautiful" (美しい, utsukushii) should come before "day" (日, hi).
Time expressions (like "Today") often appear at the beginning of the sentence.
Try again with these hints! 😊

example
ChatGPT said:
Here's an unrelated example to help you understand Japanese sentence structure:

English: I ate sushi yesterday.
Japanese: 昨日、寿司を食べました。 (Kinō, sushi o tabemashita.)

Hint: In Japanese, time expressions (e.g., "Yesterday") often appear at the beginning of the sentence, followed by the object (寿司, sushi) and then the verb (食べました, tabemashita).

Now, try constructing your sentence again! You’re doing great! 😄
