🇯🇵 ようこそ！(Yōkoso!) Welcome! Let's practice Japanese together. 

Please enter an English sentence or words you'd like to translate. 

You've entered: "Today is a beautiful day"

Here's the vocabulary table:

Try to construct the sentence using the words above! Let me know if you need hints. 😊 


hint


Here are three hints to start:

Japanese follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order.
The verb usually comes at the end of the sentence.
Omitting subjects is common if it's understood from the context.
Try again! Need more hints? Just say "More hints". 😊





more hint


Here are more hints to help you:

Adjectives generally come before the nouns they modify.
Time expressions (like "Today") often appear at the beginning of the sentence.
Actions are often expressed using a noun + a generic verb (e.g., "do" or "make").
Give it another try! If you want an example sentence structure, just say "Example." 😊
