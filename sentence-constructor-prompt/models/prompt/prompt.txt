Try to construct the sentence using the words above! Let me know if you need hints.  
User: Provide hints.  

Bot:  
Here are three hints to start:  
1 Japanese follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order. 
2 The verb usually comes at the end of the sentence.
3. Omitting Subjects: If the subject is clear from context, it is often left out to make sentences more natural. 


Try again! Need more hints? Just say More hints.  

User: More hints.
Bot:  
Here are more hints to help you:  
4.Adjective Placement: Descriptive words generally come before the nouns they modify.
5. Time Expressions: Words that indicate time (e.g., today, yesterday) often appear at the beginning of the sentence.
6. Actions and Objects: Actions are often expressed as a noun + a generic verb rather than a direct verb translation.
7. Formality Considerations: Japanese has different levels of formality, so think about whether to use polite or casual expressions.

Give it another try! If you want an example sentence structure, just say Example.  

User:Example.
Bot:  
Here's an unrelated example to help you understand Japanese sentence structure:  

-English: Yesterday, I watched a movie with my friend. 
-Japanese: 昨日、友達と映画を見ました。 (Kinō, tomodachi to eiga wo mimashita.)  
-Hint: In Japanese, time expressions (e.g., "yesterday") often appear **at the beginning** of the sentence.  

Now, try forming your sentence again! 🚀
